                <h2>Make My life Easier....</h2>
                <p>To "make your life easier" means to simplify your daily routines and tasks by decluttering your space, setting clear goals, delegating responsibilities when possible, exercising regularly, and automating repetitive actions to reduce stress and improve efficiency in your life. Being honest, I have a busy life and not a lot of spare time on my side. No amount of simplifying can wave a magic wand over my life and make it totally stress-free or a walk in the park. I think that goes for pretty much all of us at some time or other!. Life can get busy, very busy and it’s not always of our making. There are so many other factors that come into play including work, family, financial or health worries, things to do and places to be (plus so much more!). All we can really do is find a balance, simplify your life wherever possible and make intentional decisions on what supports us and what doesn’t.</p>
                <h4>Simplify your finances :-</h4>
                <p>Money is a necessity and managing it wisely is always a good thing. However, for some of us, managing our money can be stressful. We might be struggling to pay bills, dealing with debt or just can’t get our head around the maths.</p>
                <h4>Declutter your home :-</h4>
                <p>For many of us, home is where the heart is and it’s the hub of family life. Sometimes though, are homes are more a source of stress than pleasure. A cluttered home is a burden on your time and energy. Too much stuff will make your home harder to keep tidy and longer to clean.</p>
                <h4>Be intentional with your time :-</h4>
                <p>When many of us say that our life is too complicated, what we actually mean is that we’re too busy. If you can find ways to be less busy then maybe life might feel a little simpler? Being less busy isn’t always easy to achieve in normal everyday life. The key to making it work for you is to be strategic and intentional about your time and what you say ‘yes’ and ‘no’ to in the first place.</p>
                <h4>Define your priorities :-</h4>
                <p>Have you thought about what your true priorities might be? Not just the ones that shout loudest from your diary or To Do list. A new car or a bigger house? Or would it be making your kids laugh or watching them ride a bike without help for the first time? , As Stephen Covey reminds us “The key is not to prioritise what’s on your schedule, but to schedule your priorities.”</p>
                <h4>Get organised :-</h4>
                <p>Putting systems and procedures in place so you’re generally more organised, efficient and productive can make life simpler and easier. Regular weekly meal-planning and food shopping, Filing systems for paperwork and important documents and spreadsheets to track your spending.</p>
